# NbaStat

## How we can use this little script? :

* Need to install all packages from requirements.txt.
* Then in the project folder, we need to execute a `python main.py` command.
* If we make every previous step correctly, then the script sends back a successfully predicted result percentage from the last 18 years of NBA games.
